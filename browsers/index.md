# WebVR-enabled browsers

WebVR enabled browsers come in two different flavours:

* desktop browsers that can display VR content as a additional supplement to existing 2D pages
* VR-enabled, VR-first browsers which can render both the 2D page views in addition to WebVR content entirely in immersive VR

## Desktop WebVR-enabled browser experience

In this example, we use Firefox web browser. After navigating to a website with WebVR enabled content and clicking on an "Enter VR" button, the content is presented into the VR headset.

## WebVR on mobile browsers using the WebVR Polyfill

You can also view WebVR content on iOS or Android phones using browsers that do not support WebVR through the [WebVR Polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) and using a [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) viewer.
