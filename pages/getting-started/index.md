## What is WebVR?

WebVR is an experimental JavaScript API that provides access to Virtual Reality devices, such as the [Oculus Rift](https://www3.oculus.com/rift/), [HTC Vive](https://www.vive.com/), [Samsung Gear VR](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/), in your browser.

## How to view WebVR content?

To view WebVR content, you will need a compatible browser and VR headset.

* [Compatible headsets](https://dash.readme.io/project/webvr/v1.0/docs/supported-vr-systems)
* [Browser setup instructions.](https://dash.readme.io/project/webvr/v1.0/docs/downloads)
* [See browser support](iswebvrready.org)

You can also view WebVR content on IOS or Android phones using browsers that do not support WebVR through the [WebVR polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) and using a  [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) viewer.
