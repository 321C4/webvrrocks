title: WebVR enabled Browsers
---

WebVR enabled browsers come in two different flavours:   Desktop class browsers that can display VR content as a additional supplement to existing 2D pages, or as fully VR enabled browsers which can render both the 2D page views in addition to WebVR content entirely in VR.

## Desktop WebVR enabled browser experience

In this example, we use Firefox web browser.  After navigating to a website with WebVR enabled content and clicking to "Enter VR", the content is presented into the VR headset.

## Full WebVR browser experience

Full VR web browsing in Samsung Internet Browser for GearVR.   This browser includes the ability to view traditional 2D web content as well as well as WebVR enabled content.

## WebVR on mobile browsers using Polyfill.

You can also view WebVR content on IOS or Android phones using browsers that do not support WebVR through the [WebVR polyfill](https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill) and using a  [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) viewer.
